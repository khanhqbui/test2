% The number list should consist of numbers and number ranges (7-12, e.g.)
% separated by commas or spaces. The order is not random but MUST BE THE
% ORDER THAT THE PAGES ARE PRODUCED; normally this means the numbers must
% always increase.  If an invalid page number appears on the list, no pages
% will be output until the list is re-synchronized or the document ends.
% 
% Any time the document's page number does not increment normally,
% selectp.sty tries to re-synchronize the page number with the \outputonly
% list of numbers.  This is necessary when \includeonly is used. 
% 
% Pages that are labeled with roman numerals or letters should still be
% listed with a normal arabic number; page xi should be referred to as 6.
% 
% In LaTeX, unfortunately, pages i and 1 are both number 1, so it is
% tricky to skip over all the roman-numbered pages and then print
% page 1.  If there are 3 roman-numbered pages,
%   1-3      will print pages i,ii,iii; not pages 1,2,3
%   1-3,1-5  will print pages i,ii,iii,1,2,3,4,5
%   1-3,8-12 will print pages i,ii,iii,8,9,10,11,19
%   1,1-5    will print i,1,2,3,4,5
%   1-6      prints pages i,ii,iii only, not pages 4,5,6  !!!
%   0,2-6    prints pages 2,3,4,5,6, since there is no page 0 and the
%            outputonly page list is resynchronized when the actual page
%            number goes back to 1)
% 
% The last example is illuminating.  LaTeX looks for page 0, but can't find
% it. It skips pages until the page number goes from 3(iii) to 1, at which
% point it resynchronizes by reading "2" from the list, waiting for page 2
% to be produced, and then writing page 2. Selectp then reads "-6", and
% CONTINUES outputting pages until it has done page 6.  As long as the
% numbers of the intervening pages are less than 6 (the end of the range),
% those pages will be printed. 
% 
% If there are no roman numeral pages, the number list is simple, because
% the numbers must increase monotonically.
